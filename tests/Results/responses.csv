Can a school with a well-qualified teacher jump right to the Lab Support Model?,"Yes. We partner with teachers who can teach CS on their own but who may benefit from having a teacher's assistant in the classroom to provide industry-specific knowledge, be a role model, help support more students, and support with technical knowledge. In placing volunteers, we prioritize schools that do not currently have computer science but wish to offer it.","Yes, it is possible for a high school with a qualified teacher to directly implement the Lab Support Model with TEALS.","['How TEALS supports your school \nCo -Teach model Lab support model Graduation \nWho’s doing  \nthe i nstruction? \nTeacher:  10  \uf0d2 80% \nVolunteer:  90  \uf0d2 20% \nTeacher:  80  \uf0d2  99% \nVolunteer:  20  \uf0d2 1% \nTeacher:  100% \nTeacher’s role \n• Classroom and teaching team  \nmanagement \n• Learning computer science \n• Completing all assignments \n• Leading lessons at their  \ncapaci \nty \n• Classroom and teaching  \ntea \nm management \n• Leading 80%+ of lessons \n• Continue refining CS  \nunderst \nanding \n• Teaching computer science  \nindepe \nndently of TEALS \nVolunteer team  \nengagement \n4-5 days a week 2-5 days a week \nSchools teach CS on \nthe \nir own \nRemote instruction \nTEALS offers options for remote or in - \nperson volunteer support.

What computer science courses are supported by the TEALS Program?,"TEALS supports high schools in creating a CS pathway with five course options:

Introduction to Computer Science: A semester or full-year course that explores a variety of basic computational thinking and programming concepts through a project-based learning environment.
AP Computer Science Principles: A full-year course covering the fundamentals of computing including creativity, programming, and global impact.​ All curriculum providers cover the same major areas of study.
AP Computer Science A: A full-year course focused on object-oriented programming and problem solving in Java. Equivalent to a first-semester, college level course in computer science.
Cybersecurity: A full-year course that explores the fundamental concepts or applied skills of cybersecurity and may involve project-based labs in a secure environment or virtual range.
Data Science/Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence: A full-year course that explores the fundamental concepts or applied skills of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.","The TEALS Program supports five course types: Introduction to Computer Science, AP Computer Science Principles, and three other courses not specified in the given information.","['TEALS supported courses \nThe Microsoft TEALS (Technology Education and Learning Support) Program supports five course types.
