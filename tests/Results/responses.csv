You do not have the resources to do  \nit alone. \nWith limited resources and access to qualified  \ninstructors, many schools struggle to offer classes  \nbeyond core subjects. \nIf a teacher at your school is willing to learn and  \nteach a new subject, TEALS can provide the training,  \nsupport, and volunteers to make the rest happen. \n3.  Your teachers are eager—and need  \nsupport \nNew TEALS teachers do not need previous  \nexperience in CS; in fact, most don’t have a  \ntechnology background. What they do have: a  \nwillingness to try new things and learn as they go. \nTEALS guides teachers step by step. The program  \nbegins with training in the summer before the TEALS  \nclass starts. Then a teacher is matched with between  \none and four professionals who use CS in their  \ncareer. These volunteers can lead classes, offer real- \nworld examples and applications of what students  \nare learning, help with grading, answer student  \nquestions, and more. \nTEALS builds teachers’ capacity, so they take on more  \nCS instruction every year. \n4.  You’re not sure which curriculum to  \nchoose \nTeachers are already busy; many struggle to teach  \na new-to-them subject if they have to build out  \nlesson plans and curricula from scratch. That’s why  \nTEALS works closely with schools to understand their  \npriorities, then helps them choose the right provider  \nto meet those needs. This vetted curriculum ensures  \nthat teachers and volunteers receive the training and  \nresources they need to support students every step  \nof the way. \n5.  You want students to be exposed  \nto diverse careers \nStudents don’t all have equal opportunity to  \ninteract with people from a wide range of  \nbackground and careers. Yet direct exposure to  \nprofessions that once seemed out of reach can  \nexpand their idea of what is possible. \n“We found a teacher with interest in computer  \nscience and expertise in how to teach.

Remote  is a great  \nchoice for communities with limited local  \ntechnology professionals. \nWhat  your school  needs to  \nteach  remote: \n• Sufficient bandwidth, headsets , and  \nwebcams to connect students with \nvolunteers \n• TEALS training for teachers and  their \nteaching \nteams to prepare  for remote  \ninstruction \n• An assigned school staff member to \nsuppor \nt IT needs (initial installation and  \nongoing support ) \nSmithville High School, Smithville TX \nI tell my students, ‘I’m not an expert.  \nI’m learning computer science with  \nyou!’ My TEALS class is one big  \ncollaboration – and it’s fun.” \n– Elaine May ,  \nWarwick, RI, TEALS teacher \n4', '2 \n2.  You do not have the resources to do  \nit alone. \nWith limited resources and access to qualified  \ninstructors, many schools struggle to offer classes  \nbeyond core subjects. \nIf a teacher at your school is willing to learn and  \nteach a new subject, TEALS can provide the training,  \nsupport, and volunteers to make the rest happen. \n3.  Your teachers are eager—and need  \nsupport \nNew TEALS teachers do not need previous  \nexperience in CS; in fact, most don’t have a  \ntechnology background. What they do have: a  \nwillingness to try new things and learn as they go. \nTEALS guides teachers step by step. The program  \nbegins with training in the summer before the TEALS  \nclass starts. Then a teacher is matched with between  \none and four professionals who use CS in their  \ncareer. These volunteers can lead classes, offer real- \nworld examples and applications of what students  \nare learning, help with grading, answer student  \nquestions, and more. \nTEALS builds teachers’ capacity, so they take on more  \nCS instruction every year. \n4.  You’re not sure which curriculum to  \nchoose \nTeachers are already busy; many struggle to teach  \na new-to-them subject if they have to build out  \nlesson plans and curricula from scratch. That’s why  \nTEALS works closely with schools to understand their  \npriorities, then helps them choose the right provider  \nto meet those needs. This vetted curriculum ensures  \nthat teachers and volunteers receive the training and  \nresources they need to support students every step  \nof the way. \n5.  You want students to be exposed  \nto diverse careers \nStudents don’t all have equal opportunity to  \ninteract with people from a wide range of  \nbackground and careers. Yet direct exposure to  \nprofessions that once seemed out of reach can  \nexpand their idea of what is possible. \n“We found a teacher with interest in computer  \nscience and expertise in how to teach. TEALS  \nbrought the support to teach it. We wouldn’t be  \nable to do this without this partnership.” \n-Aaron Watson, Gateway High School, San  \nFrancisco \n“TEALS made me feel comfortable taking a  \nchance on a totally new subject matter. Having a  \nvolunteer expert helped fill in the gaps, especially  \nmy first year of teaching computer science. I was  \nlearning as I was teaching.” \n-Lauren Wells, computer science and science  \nteacher, Brooklyn College Academy, Brooklyn, NY \n“If we don’t show them what types of jobs  \nthey can get after high school or college, they  \njust don’t know. It’s important for them to  \nsee diverse careers so hopefully they can see  \nthemselves in that job, too.” \n-Rita Skyers, assistant principal, Oakland High  \nSchool \n“With TEALS, I have a road map.

The persons making the comments may be otherwise well-intentioned and unaware of the potential \nimpact of their words.” \nBecause microaggressions repeat or affirm stereotypes about a group or subtly demean its members without being \noutright confrontational, such comments also position the dominant culture (Euro-American) as normal and the \nmarginalized group as aberrant. \nAccording to Sue and Spanierman, there are three main types of microaggressions: microinsults (e.g., a girl is told \nshe is pretty, “for a Black girl”), microinvalidations (e.g., asking someone of Asian, Middle Eastern, or Latin descent \nwhere they are “really from”), and microassaults (e.g., a teacher making homophobic comments in class). You can \nfind additional examples of different forms of microaggressions  here \n. \nWHAT ANTIRACISM MEANS \n(https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Microaggressions+in+Everyday+Life%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119513797) \n(https://www.higheredtoday.org/2016/07/27/understanding-and-combatting-microaggressions-in-postsecondary-education/) \nGEORGE LUCAS EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION', '11/28/23, 1:45 PM Disrupting Your Texts: Why Simply Including Diverse Voices Is Not Enough \nhttps://www.literacyworldwide.org/blog/literacy-now/2019/09/05/disrupting-your-texts-why-simply-including-diverse-voices-is-not-enough 2 / 5 \nIn May \n2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) released its  Hate at School  report. Using information \ngathered from teacher questionnaires and news media   reports, the SPLC found an alarming uptick in \nthe number of incidents of hate and   bias occurring in U.S. schools. Teachers reported that the most \ncommon driver   of these incidents was racial or ethnic bias, with anti-LGBTQ bias a close second. \nFurthermore, a majority of these incidents occurred in spaces where adults were present: 32 %  in \nclassrooms and 37 %  in shared spaces such as hallways, bathrooms, or other parts of the building. \nThink about what that means. The majority of incidents of hate and bias occur  in the presence of \nadults . \nAs teachers, we do our best to make sure that all of our students are safe and seen in our schools. But \nthe truth is that even the most well-intentioned teachers will miss things—harmful things— sometimes \nin our own classrooms. What might be the microaggressions, for example, against Indigenous students, \nstudents of color, and LGBTQ students occurring in our classrooms that teachers—who are \noverwhelmingly white in the United States—may not notice? What unexamined biases do we as \neducators bring into our classrooms that could have a potentially harmful impact on our kids? \nAs literacy teachers, we have one of the most powerful resources available to \x00ght against hate and \nbias: We have stories. The stories—and, more important, the  counter -stories, the  counternarratives— \nthat we choose to share with students are instrumental in helping all our students be seen and heard, \nappreciated and understood. This is especially critical for students from communities whose stories \nare too o\x00en oversimpli\x00ed, misrepresented, or rendered invisible in the dominant culture and \nmainstream media.

Build the culture of your school on an institutional level:  Think of yourself as an agent for a healthy, antiracist \nculture, not as the sole creator of it. Leaders in schools should not be responsible for managing or mediating every \nsingle aggression (micro- or macro-), but they should be explicit about expectations and values. Make sure that the \nnorms of communication around microaggressions (indeed, around any racist behavior) are clear, including to new \nstaff members. \n2. Ritualize meeting spaces:  Develop humanizing ways to begin and close meetings. Check-in questions (e.g., \nchecking in on highs and lows), sharing across differences (e.g., “From the skin I am in...”), and mindful practices at \nthe beginning of a meeting help to bring folks into a shared space. Closing rituals such as process checks, which \nsurface patterns of participation and facilitator moves, bring a reflective and purposeful closing tone. Developing \nconsistent meeting structures and roles helps to flatten positional hierarchy, especially in cultures that put a strong \nemphasis on titles and positions. \n3. Prioritize a shared vision and language:  Make sure the adults in the building are employing the same language \nand concepts when it comes to antiracism work. This allows for individuals to access shared values and concepts \nwhen attempting to have brave conversations with their students and colleagues. Terms such as  implicit bias , \nstructural racism ,  White supremacy , and  microaggressions  should be explicitly taught, discussed, and defined within \nthe context of the local school community and history. \n4. Establish norms that create brave spaces:  While they have merit in certain contexts, safe spaces are sometimes \ntoo safe and enable some folks to lean on their “right to comfort,” a symptom of White supremacy culture that aims \nto smooth over conflict without getting to the root of the issues. Instead, norms should reflect a culture of curiosity, \nlistening, and vulnerability: bravery. In brave spaces, adults can work in their optimal zone of development. \n5. Practice a culture of microaffirmations:  In  one study , conducted \nby SF Build, an organization founded to mentor students of color in the sciences, microaffirmations are described as \n“affirmations that people of your culture and ethnicity are important contributors to advancing knowledge in this \nfield.” SF Build’s research found that the practice of microaffirmations directly correlates with a student’s intention to \npersist in a field. \nIf microaffirmations have a strong impact on the persistence of college freshmen in the sciences, they can also \nactively contribute to the sense of belonging of students and faculty of color in an international environment. To me, \nmicroaffirmations can include explicit recognition of a person’s contributions and skills and images of excellence of \nwomen and the contributions of people of color to any field of study. \n6. Hire and retain a diverse faculty and staff:  Your faculty and staff should reflect the majority of the young people \nthey are working with; if you work in an international school like I do, then they should reflect the global majority of \nstudents. The world is increasingly interconnected, and issues of colonization, oppression, and social justice are \nbeing valued by government agencies, Fortune 500 businesses, and universities. Schools need to hire and retain \nfaculty and staff of color to reflect the diversity that students will experience when they enter higher education and \nthe workforce. \nMoreover, a diverse faculty will naturally bring a wider range of viewpoints and experiences to share with students \nand the community. Value this diversity of viewpoints, and use these perspectives to build shared understanding and \nexpectations with students and families about what school values stand for. \n7. Engage in storytelling:  Storytelling helps to build intentional personal and professional relationships around \nshared values and identity. As an ancient tradition, storytelling activates emotions, helps people build connections, \nand supports the storyteller in anchoring their identity within their own context. It is a powerful way to build \n(https://sfbuild.sfsu.edu/sites/default/files/Estrada_2019.pdf)', '11/28/23, 1:40 PM 7 Steps Toward Building an Equitable School Culture | Edutopia \nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/7-steps-toward-building-equitable-school-culture 4 / 11 \nSchool Culture Administration & Leadership Education Equity \ncommunity within a classroom or a staff meeting. (See  “Building Community With Restorative Circles.” \n(/article/building-community-restorative-circles) ) \nBALANCING PATIENCE WITH URGENCY \nEducators dedicated to equity need to channel their energy toward their own regenerative process so that they may \nhave the courage to start the real work of justice. This means making a commitment—while slowing down. It may \ntake longer for a school or institution to start this work, but once it does, issues ranging from student discipline to \nstaff culture that once seem isolated will begin to improve. Most of the time, a challenge within a school system is a \nsymptom of an inequity in the process, structure, or people in the organization. When equity initiatives are \nthoughtfully planned, they can have far-reaching impacts in an institution. \nAs social justice educators, we need to bring awareness of these challenges to the forefront of the education \ncommunity. Ask yourself these questions: \nWhat role do you play in justice work, and how does that relate to your current relationships with students and other faculty? \nHave you thought about your students and faculty of color through the lens of these stereotypes? \nIf you are an educator of color, are you ready to engage with your whole self, including the parts of you that institutions are \nasking you to leave at the door? \nFor more information and learning on microaggressions, explore  this list \n(https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/microaggressions.pdf)  of common microaggressions and the assumptions \nthat they presume, and  this short reading  on how to respond to \nmicroaggressions as the receiver, a bystander, or the perpetrator. \nSHARE THIS STORY \nFILED UNDER \nADMINISTRATION & LEADERSHIP \nHow to Stay Connected to Students as a New Administrator \nIn order to understand what’s going on in classrooms, it’s important for \nnew administrators to regularly make time to interact with students. \nB y   Heather Wolpert-Gawron \nNovember 20, 2023 \n(https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/01/microaggressions)']"

How can I connect Physical and Virtual Learning Spaces," The design of a learning space can act as a catalyst to promote collaboration and innovation. Seamless integration
 of technology into classroom furniture and lessons can empower students to create personalized paths to learning.
 You can design a collaboration station by moving a flat-edged table to a wall. Chairs surrounding the table will invite
 student groups to work and collaborate here. An Apple TV added to a mounted flat-screen television lets you mirror
 devices during project sessions. Physical spaces can then be connected to virtual spaces through creativity and
 productivity apps. Classrooms can create international learning teams with students of the world, and then use apps-- such as Nearpod

 , and Periscope

This site can help you focus your attention on one or two civic tasks with broader impact. \nSocial action is also a great way to involve students, which multiplies your impact. You can teach students how to \nwrite emails or letters by asking them to write to your local government in favor of policy changes banning the eight \nmost deadly policing strategies listed at  8 Can’t Wait , which has ideas on how to call or email \nyour government yourself—there’s a script you can use or adapt. \nLooking within:  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, take inventory of your feelings. It’s normal to be most \ncomfortable around people who are like you. It’s just not good when that makes you and those like you an “us” and \nthose who aren’t like you a “them.” Use a journal to sort through your personal feelings on racism or read  books that \nprovide perspective  on systemic inequities and bias.

One bite at a time, of course—and achieving equity is no \ndifferent. Take small bites that can have big impact and don’t worry about getting it wrong sometimes, as you \ninevitably will. If you keep going, you can do something that brings about change. \nReading:  Even if you only have 10 minutes, you can learn something to help you create a more equitable classroom. \nWebsites like  Teaching Tolerance , the NEA’s  EdJustice , and \nKQED’s  Mindshift  feature resources for lesson \nplanning as well as lessons for you as a teacher. Teaching Tolerance is the perfect place to start, whether you want \nto use  bias-free language  to  teach tolerance \n through reading with young learners or plan a  social action \ncampaign  with high school students. \nIn addition to a rich collection of K–12 classroom resources, the website features self-guided PD, on-demand \nwebinars, and podcasts that may enable you to earn a certificate—check with your administration first. Those can \neasily be broken up into small chunks of time. And note that many of the site’s  feature articles \n list recommended actions at the bottom. \nIf your goal is to understand the Black community better, sites designed for Black audiences like  The Root \n,  The Undefeated , \nand Huffington Post’s  Black Voices  are good places to start. These non- \nmainstream media outlets feature content by minority and minority-supporting journalists. You’ll find content on \ntopics not covered in mainstream media, like coverage of  historically Black colleges and universities \n, news about Black brands and influencers, and stories like this one on  MIT’s first Black \nfemale student body president  in its \n159-year history. If you’re teaching Black children who are generally inundated by media that does not reflect them, \nthese are priceless ways you can enrich your current events and show-and-tell circles. \nWatching:  You can improve your cultural competence and learn about Black Lives Matter by watching “ 4 Black Lives \nMatter Myths Debunked ” on YouTube, which will answer quite a few \nquestions on social justice issues, probably including some you didn’t even know you had.

Following organizations like  EduColor \n and hashtags like  #BlackTeachersMatter \n and  #Equity  will \nyield content from educators who either teach people of color, are people of color, or both. And consider visiting a \nBlack church, which you can do even now online:  The Potter’s House of Fort Worth’s Pastor Patrick E. Winfield II \n, for example, is an educator who regularly addresses social issues. Even if religion isn’t your \nthing,  the Black church is a good place to go (/article/lessons-culturally-responsive-teaching-black-churches)  to gain culturally \nrelevant perspectives. \nTaking action:  For the civic-minded, the Kellogg Foundation has put together a website that lets you  create your own \npersonal plan  to support, donate, or volunteer in the way you \nfind most relevant. This site can help you focus your attention on one or two civic tasks with broader impact. \nSocial action is also a great way to involve students, which multiplies your impact. You can teach students how to \nwrite emails or letters by asking them to write to your local government in favor of policy changes banning the eight \nmost deadly policing strategies listed at  8 Can’t Wait , which has ideas on how to call or email \nyour government yourself—there’s a script you can use or adapt. \nLooking within:  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, take inventory of your feelings. It’s normal to be most \ncomfortable around people who are like you. It’s just not good when that makes you and those like you an “us” and \nthose who aren’t like you a “them.” Use a journal to sort through your personal feelings on racism or read  books that \nprovide perspective  on systemic inequities and bias. These long-haul \nstrategies will produce change in you while you take more immediate action in other ways. \nThe devastating events of the last days have left me shaken. I have felt anger, fear, grief—so many emotions. But I \nhave also felt buoyed by the great outpouring of support from my less melanated colleagues who want to listen, \nlearn, and find out how to do better. So many of them are already doing amazing things with diverse students. This \npiece is dedicated to them.

Build the culture of your school on an institutional level:  Think of yourself as an agent for a healthy, antiracist \nculture, not as the sole creator of it. Leaders in schools should not be responsible for managing or mediating every \nsingle aggression (micro- or macro-), but they should be explicit about expectations and values. Make sure that the \nnorms of communication around microaggressions (indeed, around any racist behavior) are clear, including to new \nstaff members. \n2. Ritualize meeting spaces:  Develop humanizing ways to begin and close meetings. Check-in questions (e.g., \nchecking in on highs and lows), sharing across differences (e.g., “From the skin I am in...”), and mindful practices at \nthe beginning of a meeting help to bring folks into a shared space. Closing rituals such as process checks, which \nsurface patterns of participation and facilitator moves, bring a reflective and purposeful closing tone. Developing \nconsistent meeting structures and roles helps to flatten positional hierarchy, especially in cultures that put a strong \nemphasis on titles and positions. \n3. Prioritize a shared vision and language:  Make sure the adults in the building are employing the same language \nand concepts when it comes to antiracism work. This allows for individuals to access shared values and concepts \nwhen attempting to have brave conversations with their students and colleagues. Terms such as  implicit bias , \nstructural racism ,  White supremacy , and  microaggressions  should be explicitly taught, discussed, and defined within \nthe context of the local school community and history. \n4. Establish norms that create brave spaces:  While they have merit in certain contexts, safe spaces are sometimes \ntoo safe and enable some folks to lean on their “right to comfort,” a symptom of White supremacy culture that aims \nto smooth over conflict without getting to the root of the issues. Instead, norms should reflect a culture of curiosity, \nlistening, and vulnerability: bravery. In brave spaces, adults can work in their optimal zone of development. \n5. Practice a culture of microaffirmations:  In  one study , conducted \nby SF Build, an organization founded to mentor students of color in the sciences, microaffirmations are described as \n“affirmations that people of your culture and ethnicity are important contributors to advancing knowledge in this \nfield.” SF Build’s research found that the practice of microaffirmations directly correlates with a student’s intention to \npersist in a field. \nIf microaffirmations have a strong impact on the persistence of college freshmen in the sciences, they can also \nactively contribute to the sense of belonging of students and faculty of color in an international environment. To me, \nmicroaffirmations can include explicit recognition of a person’s contributions and skills and images of excellence of \nwomen and the contributions of people of color to any field of study. \n6. Hire and retain a diverse faculty and staff:  Your faculty and staff should reflect the majority of the young people \nthey are working with; if you work in an international school like I do, then they should reflect the global majority of \nstudents. The world is increasingly interconnected, and issues of colonization, oppression, and social justice are \nbeing valued by government agencies, Fortune 500 businesses, and universities. Schools need to hire and retain \nfaculty and staff of color to reflect the diversity that students will experience when they enter higher education and \nthe workforce. \nMoreover, a diverse faculty will naturally bring a wider range of viewpoints and experiences to share with students \nand the community. Value this diversity of viewpoints, and use these perspectives to build shared understanding and \nexpectations with students and families about what school values stand for. \n7. Engage in storytelling:  Storytelling helps to build intentional personal and professional relationships around \nshared values and identity. As an ancient tradition, storytelling activates emotions, helps people build connections, \nand supports the storyteller in anchoring their identity within their own context. It is a powerful way to build \n(https://sfbuild.sfsu.edu/sites/default/files/Estrada_2019.pdf)']"

Therefore, set realistic goals and focus on small, \nhigh-leverage steps that yield tangible shifts in the interpersonal dynamics between the staff. Improved discourse \nbetween educators and making faculty meetings intellectually safe spaces are two important goals. This way, \nteachers and staff won’t be afraid to voice their views and get constructive feedback. \nAn important takeaway here is that the adults collectively need to take the necessary time to create positive change \nin school-wide climate, culture, policy, routines, and rituals before it can occur with students. \nSuccessful outcomes in school climate and culture will require conversations, resources, and actionable steps both \nin faculty meetings and classrooms. \nDifficult conversations in schools pertinent to DEI vary depending on school context (e.g., population \ndemographics). Some may include, but are not limited to, defining antiracist work, improving inclusion for various \ngroups, managing diversity for making schools safe, carrying out equitable practices, and enabling diverse \nnarratives across the curriculum. \nWhen dealing with topics involving race or others where the adults don’t agree (e.g., social justice, emotionally \ncharged current events, systemic racism), it’s critical to establish  equity of voice \n, set ground rules for continued discussions, and define \nmicroaggressions in order to develop a school-wide culture of inclusivity that is free from harm for all. The term \nmicroaggressions  often refers to both intentional and unintentional verbal, behavioral, and environmental insults \nperpetrated against people of color. \nIt’s important to note that microaggressions are not just about race. Dr. Derald Wing Sue wrote in  his paper \n on the subject, “While microaggressions are \ngenerally discussed from the perspective of race and racism, any marginalized group in our society may become \ntargets: people of color, women, LGBT persons, those with disabilities, religious minorities, and so on.” \nTry using  circle practice (/article/using-circle-practice-classroom)  to provide structure for difficult conversations between \neducators. To make a safe and inclusive environment for staff, these are some of the transformational norms and \nagreements I encourage school leaders to model and implement with their staffs during circles: \n1. Everyone participates.  This does not mean that everyone will speak, but it does mean that everyone will look and \npay attention to whoever is speaking. \n2. Don’t require people of color on staff to share their traumatic experiences or lead the work.  Instead, provide us \nthe opportunities to contribute according to our comfort levels, and be mindful not to tokenize us. Consider bringing \nin experts who have checked their own biases and who have valid DEI expertise—regarding research, methodology, \nand facilitation. \n3. Speak from the heart, and be open to feedback.  Staff members are encouraged to speak their truth respectfully. \nThey will also need to be open to receiving feedback when their perspective needs to change because it limits \nstudents and thus causes harm to them and other colleagues. \n4. Listen from the heart.  Staff members are encouraged to listen to their colleagues without allowing their personal \nviews to write them off completely. This will be difficult, but the structure and norms will allow for constructive \nfeedback and dialogue to occur over time, which will cause some people to eventually change their limiting beliefs \n(implicit biases) that harm students. \n(https://kate.frykberg.co.nz/2017/01/09/equity-of-voice-and-why-it-matters/) \n(https://www.uua.org/files/pdf/m/microaggressions_by_derald_wing_sue_ph.d._.pdf)']"

The jury  \nis still out on many aspects of this theory, but estimating  \nperson-environment  fit  —  deciding  whether  I  belong  \nhere  —  is clearly an important element of career choice.  \nFor  this  reason,  efforts  to  attract  a  broader  population  \nto  computing  must  avoid  communicating  stereotypes  \nthat  lead  women  or  other  underrepresented  groups  to  \nfeel  they  would  not  fit  comfortably  in  a  computing  major   \nor occupation. \nThe  design  of  physical  spaces  communicates  beliefs  about  what  \nkinds  of  people  belong  in  them  and  what  kinds  of  activities  should  \nbe done in them (Hattenauer, 1984).  Imagine if doctors’ offices were  \ndesigned  like  dry  cleaning  shops:  no  room  or  furniture  for  sitting,  \nclear view of what goes on behind the desks, and open glass front  \nwindows. Patients would not expect to wait long for their appointments  \nnor could they reasonably expect privacy during a consultation. The  \nmedical profession would be, for better or worse, revolutionized. \nMany of us have experienced being in a place where we felt like  \nwe  did  not  belong,  a  place  designed  for  someone  not  like  us.  \nFor  example,  you  might  have  been  a  staunch  rock  and  roll  fan  \nin  a  country-western  bar,  with  wagon  wheels,  mounted  moose  \nheads, and cow hides on the walls.   Most people prefer to avoid  \nor  leave  environments  where  they  feel  like  they  don’t  belong  —  \neven  if  they  can’t  explain  what  makes  them  feel  uncomfortable  \n— and that reaction helps explain women’s absence or departure   \nfrom computing. \nCommonly held beliefs about gender, technology, and the relationship between the two shape the context for participation in computing.  \nThese  beliefs  stereotype  computing  as  masculine,  which  influences  thoughts  and  expectations  about  the  type  of  person  suited  for  \ncomputing  study  and  work.  Often  operating  at  a  subconscious  level,  these  stereotypes  affect  feelings  of  belonging  in  computing  \nenvironments. \nStereotypes are communicated in a variety of ways, including cues in the physical or virtual environment. For example, rooms decorated  \nwith images and objects associated with “geeky” stereotypes are less appealing and welcoming to women than are gender neutral rooms.  \nLikewise, online classrooms decorated with these stereotyped images lead women to feel that this environment is not for them. Research  \nhas shown that this effect of stereotyped environments  measurably reduces women’s interest in declaring a computing major and  \ntheir anticipated success in computing.  \nThe physical environment is one of several factors that contribute to the gender gap in computing.  Together with other commonplace  \npractices and situations, it helps to create a climate where women feel more or less comfortable.  Understanding this influence allows us  \nto actively craft a more gender-balanced field. \nCREATE  A WElCOMING ENvIRONMENT  \nCreate a physical environment that communicates a sense of belonging to a broad population. According to research done with college  \nstudents,  items  such  as  stacked  soda  cans,  Star Trek  and  Star  Wars  images  and  paraphernalia,  video  game  boxes,  comics,  science  \nfiction books, electronics, and computer parts communicate a lower sense of belonging to women than men. Objects such as these create  \na comfortable environment for only a narrow portion of the population. To instead welcome a wider range of people into computing, create  \na more gender neutral ambiance with items including plants, art or nature posters, water and a coffee maker, or general interest books  \nand magazines.', '11/28/23, 1:41 PM Collaborative Learning Spaces: Classrooms That Connect to the World | Edutopia \nhttps://www.edutopia.org/blog/collaborative-learning-spaces-connect-to-world-jennifer-williams-fran-siracusa 3 / 10 \nFlexible Classrooms Collaborative Learning Learning Environments \nStudent Engagement Social Studies/History \nalbums.

Make Every Space a Space for Learning \nIn the process of designing a collaborative learning space, all available areas should be considered spaces for \nlearning. Hallways can become meeting spaces for small groups, glass and windows can be transformed into writing \nspaces, and classroom walls can allow groups to visually map out thinking. By removing the conventional teacher \ndesk, teachers and students will better understand their evolving roles as co-constructors of knowledge. Without a \nfront of the room, every seat is the best seat in the class, and students are always at the center of learning. Flexible \nseating allows for spaces to transform depending on the purpose of the lesson. Varied seating options, too, such as \nstools, rocking chairs, beanbag chairs, and floor seating, give students choice and variability throughout the day. \n3. Connect Physical and Virtual Learning Spaces \nThe design of a learning space can act as a catalyst to promote collaboration and innovation. Seamless integration \nof technology into classroom furniture and lessons can empower students to create personalized paths to learning. \nYou can design a  collaboration station  by moving a flat-edged table to a wall. Chairs surrounding the table will invite \nstudent groups to work and collaborate here. An Apple TV added to a mounted flat-screen television lets you mirror \ndevices during project sessions. Physical spaces can then be connected to virtual spaces through creativity and \nproductivity apps. Classrooms can create international learning teams with students of the world, and then use apps \n-- such as  Nearpod ,  Padlet ,  Kahoot! ,  Google Drive \n, and  Periscope  -- in global collaborations and projects. \nVideoconferencing platforms like  Google Hangouts  and Skype in the Classroom allow \nstudents to connect to the world through conversations and sharing their stories. \nCollaborative learning spaces have the power to transform learning and teaching. The landscape of a connected \nclassroom unites pedagogy, space, and standards of instruction. By connecting to global classrooms in meaningful \nand authentic ways, there can be endless opportunities for collaboration and engagement, and, in effect, the world \nbecomes the learning space of the classroom. \nS H A R E   T H I S   S T O R Y \nF I L E D   U N D E R \nT H E   R E S E A R C H   I S   I N \nThe Science of Classroom Design \nOur comprehensive, all-in, research-based look at the design of effective \nlearning spaces. \nB y   Youki Terada ,   Stephen Merrill \nNovember 2, 2023 \n(https://www.nearpod.com/) (https://padlet.com/) (https://getkahoot.com/) \n(https://www.google.com/drive/) (https://www.periscope.tv/) \n(https://hangouts.google.com/)', ""Graduate Undergraduate K-12 education Career \nNational Center for Women & Information Technology \nP R O M I S I N G   P R A C T I C E S \nDesign Physical Space that Has  broad Appeal (Case Study 1) \nAffecting Women’s Entry and Persistence in Computing through Physical Space \nHank  Levy,  Chair  of  the  University  of  Washington’s  Department  \nof  Computer  Science  &  Engineering,  described  the  design  of  \na  new  building  that  applied  principles  supported  by  research  on  \nstereotypes and the environment.

Unlike  \nmost  academic  buildings,  there  are  no  conference  or  technical  \nposters  lining  the  hallways.  Instead,  occupants  and  visitors  see  \na collection of original paintings, prints, and photographs from 22  \nuniversity-affiliated  artists  whenever  they  enter  or  leave  a  floor  in  \nthe building.

By seamlessly \nconnecting pedagogy, technology, and space, teachers can create spaces that promote social learning and \nmaximum engagement. These collaborative classrooms are alive with action -- teaching, learning, innovating, \ncreating, making, and exploring. Innovative learning spaces can encourage both individual and collective voices, \nand, through use of emerging technologies, they inspire students to become skillful curators of their digital worlds. \nThough there cannot be a single universal blueprint for designing a collaborative learning space, teachers can use \nthe goal of global collaboration to inspire classroom design that allows for connected sharing and learning. \nWhile there are many design ideas that could help drive this transformation, we suggest the following three as a \nstarting point. \n1. Involve Students in the Process From the Beginning \nThe design of a collaborative learning space begins with a dialogue between all stakeholders. Everyone, including \nteachers and students, are part of the conversation and the design experience from the start. With a focus on \npurpose, together they can create plans for a classroom that will invite active participation and inquiry. This \nestablishes a framework that evolves the role of the classroom teacher from distant lecturer to engaged facilitator of \nlearning. As partners in the design process, the teacher and the students can together take a holistic approach to \ndefine the goals of a collaborative learning space by answering the question: ""How will learning look in our \nclassroom?"" Curricular content can be integrated into the design process, and digital tools can allow for creativity \nand critical thinking. The  Bubbli  app allows users to create 360-degree spherical photos called bubbles. \nStudents can capture entire scenes of classrooms, including floors, ceilings, walls, and everything in between, and \nthen they can add audio. Social tools allow for bubbles to be directly shared with the world and organized into \n(http://bubb.li/)']"
What factors suggest TEALS isn't for your school?,"1. Your school serves only K-8 students
2. Your school already has a builtout CS pathway
3. You want support in a specific CS topic.","TEALS may not be a good fit for a school if they serve only K-8 students, already have a built-out CS pathway, or want support in a specific CS topic such as web design or app development.","['2 \n2.  You do not have the resources to do  \nit alone. \nWith limited resources and access to qualified  \ninstructors, many schools struggle to offer classes  \nbeyond core subjects. \nIf a teacher at your school is willing to learn and  \nteach a new subject, TEALS can provide the training,  \nsupport, and volunteers to make the rest happen. \n3.  Your teachers are eager—and need  \nsupport \nNew TEALS teachers do not need previous  \nexperience in CS; in fact, most don’t have a  \ntechnology background. What they do have: a  \nwillingness to try new things and learn as they go. \nTEALS guides teachers step by step. The program  \nbegins with training in the summer before the TEALS  \nclass starts. Then a teacher is matched with between  \none and four professionals who use CS in their  \ncareer. These volunteers can lead classes, offer real- \nworld examples and applications of what students  \nare learning, help with grading, answer student  \nquestions, and more. \nTEALS builds teachers’ capacity, so they take on more  \nCS instruction every year. \n4.  You’re not sure which curriculum to  \nchoose \nTeachers are already busy; many struggle to teach  \na new-to-them subject if they have to build out  \nlesson plans and curricula from scratch. That’s why  \nTEALS works closely with schools to understand their  \npriorities, then helps them choose the right provider  \nto meet those needs. This vetted curriculum ensures  \nthat teachers and volunteers receive the training and  \nresources they need to support students every step  \nof the way. \n5.  You want students to be exposed  \nto diverse careers \nStudents don’t all have equal opportunity to  \ninteract with people from a wide range of  \nbackground and careers. Yet direct exposure to  \nprofessions that once seemed out of reach can  \nexpand their idea of what is possible. \n“We found a teacher with interest in computer  \nscience and expertise in how to teach. TEALS  \nbrought the support to teach it. We wouldn’t be  \nable to do this without this partnership.” \n-Aaron Watson, Gateway High School, San  \nFrancisco \n“TEALS made me feel comfortable taking a  \nchance on a totally new subject matter. Having a  \nvolunteer expert helped fill in the gaps, especially  \nmy first year of teaching computer science. I was  \nlearning as I was teaching.” \n-Lauren Wells, computer science and science  \nteacher, Brooklyn College Academy, Brooklyn, NY \n“If we don’t show them what types of jobs  \nthey can get after high school or college, they  \njust don’t know. It’s important for them to  \nsee diverse careers so hopefully they can see  \nthemselves in that job, too.” \n-Rita Skyers, assistant principal, Oakland High  \nSchool \n“With TEALS, I have a road map. TEALS saves  \nyou from stressing about what to teach next.” \n-Lauren Wells, computer science and science  \nteacher, Brooklyn College Academy, Brooklyn, NY', '4 \n9.  You want more direct    \ninstruction time \nWith volunteers in the classroom—whether it’s in- \nperson or virtual—teachers have more time to work  \nwith students one-on-one and in small groups. With  \nmore adults in the classroom, students get more  \nindividualized instruction. \n“Usually, teachers simply don’t have enough  \nhands. Working with my volunteers is literally  \nlike having two extra teachers. They grade, they  \nteach, they come up with awesome additions to  \nthe curriculum. They help make sure everyone is  \ngetting face time with a teacher.” \n-Lauren Wells, Brooklyn College Academy \n10.  You think big—and want to develop  \na CS pathway \nTEALS doesn’t aim to turn every student into a  \ntechnologist, but the program does strive to make it  \npossible for any student to discover a new passion.  \nThat’s one reason why TEALS is designed to grow  \nwith your school. \nTeachers can start out with a lot of volunteer  \nsupport, then gradually take on more of the course  \ninstruction. They, or other teachers in the school, can  \nalso begin to teach additional CS classes—with the  \nsupport of TEALS. \nIn this way, students can take a sequence of CS  \nclasses that build on one another, which deepens  \ntheir knowledge of a vitally important subject. \n“Partnering with TEALS has allowed CS4All  \nto offer schools an expanded selection of  \nintroductory courses, like TEALS Intro to CS,  \nwhich is a popular course with schools preparing  \nstudents for AP CSP.” \n-José Olivares, CS4All’s Director of High School  \nAcademics, New York, NY \nNot the right fit? \nNot every school is a good match for the TEALS program. The factors that suggest TEALS isn’t for your school: \nYour school serves only K-8  \nstudents.  That’s great if you want  \nto bring CS education to younger  \nstudents! However, TEALS is  \ndesigned for high school students  \nand teachers. \nYour school already has a built- \nout CS pathway.

What are SEL competencies?,SEL competencies are a guide to show educators how they can help learners understand themselves and others to develop the skills to become better students and people. ,SEL competencies are a guide to show educators how they can help learners understand themselves and others to develop the skills to become better students and people.,"[""11/28/23, 1:45 PM ISTE | 3 Ways Teachers Can Integrate SEL Into Learning | ISTE \nhttps://iste.org/blog/3-ways-teachers-can-integrate-sel-into-learning 6 / 10 \nStep 3: Help students improve their emotional \nintelligence\xa0 \nResearch  shows that SEL can yield terrific behavioral and academic outcomes for kids when \nintegrated with classroom content. The self-awareness competency in  CASEL's integrated \nframework  is an excellent resource for helping students begin to understand their \nemotional responses  and thereby strengthen their emotional intelligence (EQ) skills. And for \nthis purpose, our daily lessons can be instrumental as they navigate their EQ journey.\xa0 \nThe work  of psychologist and journalist Daniel Goleman tells us that EQ has five important \nelements — self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills.  Labeling \nemotions  is an essential first step required for students to become self-aware and to begin \nto manage their emotional states effectively as they work to develop EQ.\xa0 \nPlutchik’s Wheel of Emotions  is an excellent tool for simplifying emotions for students by \nfocusing them on eight basic ones (anger, anticipation, joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, and \ndisgust). The wheel also enables them to categorize emotions into primary ones and \nrecognize that the emotions they experience can be a combination of the eight basic \nemotions or stem from one or more of them. This is very empowering for young people.\xa0 \nNow that learners have a better understanding of how they respond emotionally, we can \nhave them begin to label their emotions and identify and implement SEL strategies to put \nthemselves back in a peaceful state. For this, I like to incorporate emotion check-ins using an \n“emotions planner” in both my remote or in-person lessons.\xa0 \nThis simple check-in can be in response to a new concept we are covering or products they \nare actively working on. The students and I then identify SEL strategies to regulate any of \ntheir emotions effectively. \n\ue900 \nCHAT WITH US"", '11/28/23, 1:45 PM ISTE | 3 Ways Teachers Can Integrate SEL Into Learning | ISTE \nhttps://iste.org/blog/3-ways-teachers-can-integrate-sel-into-learning 4 / 10 \nSEL competencies  are a guide to show educators how they can help learners understand \nthemselves and others to develop the skills to become better students and people. But \nbefore we can engage them in SEL, we must know and understand them culturally and \nsocially. Otherwise, helping them learn and apply new life and social skills will likely not \noccur. \nOnce you’ve reviewed the resources above, it’s time to start creating your own SEL plan that \nincludes research-based pedagogies for helping make you more culturally and socially \ncompetent.

This can serve as a quick reference and guide for both your own future \nprofessional development and lesson planning. \nFor example, I teach a diverse group of students, and some belong to cultures other than \nmy own. To make my lessons more engaging and relevant to them, I need to learn how to \nbecome more culturally responsive in my teaching by making meaningful connections \nbetween the content I teach and their cultures, languages and personal experiences. This \nwill include learning to design lessons that accurately represent them and their interests by \nleveling up my knowledge base and teaching practice for effective, culturally responsive \nteaching (CRT).\xa0 \nAfter learning what  CRT  actually is by diving into reputable resources, I began developing \nmy own plan for how I can start to be more culturally responsive in my remote teaching. \nPlease see the graphic below.\xa0 \n\ue900 \nCHAT WITH US', '11/28/23, 1:43 PM How to Get Started Integrating SEL Into Lessons | Edutopia \nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/getting-started-integrating-sel-lessons 4 / 11 \nSocial & Emotional Learning (SEL) Culturally Responsive Teaching New Teachers \nneed to create.

Learning computer science (CS) helps  \npeople better understand our technology-enabled  \nworld. It positions students for high-demand jobs  \nand provides them with skills that are broadly  \napplicable — illuminating new approaches to  \nproblem-solving, critical thinking and creativity.  \nSchools across the country and around the world  \nare working to increase access to quality CS  \neducation. But while CS classes and opportunities  \nare expanding, too many students — especially  \ngirls, Black, Latino and Native American youth —  \nfeel like it’s not for them. As a result, the whole  \nworld misses out on the diverse perspectives  \nneeded to fuel innovation and drive change. \n1 \n  \nThe insights and tools in this kit will help ensure  \nall young people understand the value of a CS  \neducation and feel welcomed and empowered to  \nsucceed. \nWhat is Computer Science? \nComputer science, or “CS,” is a very large subject.  \nIt blends all the “STEM” subjects of science,  \ntechnology, engineering and math, and also  \nincludes design.    It \n’s important for students to  \nlearn these skills because computer science is  \neverywhere. By increasing access to CS for all youth  \nas early as possible, we help them prepare for the  \njobs of today and tomorrow. This education gives  \nthem the opportunity to become the world’s next  \ninnovators. \nWhy engage girls in CS? \nIdeas in computer science are shaping our world  \nand solving some of its biggest challenges. The  \npeople who work in this industry should be as  \ndiverse as the world they are shaping. And when  \ngirls are introduced to the impact and creativity  \ninvolved in CS careers, their perspective on them  \nchanges dramatically. \nJobs that rely on knowledge of computers are also  \nin high demand. People who major in CS in college  \ncan earn 40 percent more money than the average  \ncollege graduate. \n2 \nBy 2026, there will be an estimated 3.5 million  \ncomputing-related jobs open in the United  \nStates. However, only 17 percent of these jobs  \nare expected to be filled by graduates of U.S.  \ncolleges and universities. \n3 \n  \nThese patterns present a prime opportunity for  \nteachers and parents to help girls and young  \nwomen learn about and prepare for these high- \ndemand, high-reward careers. And make no  \nmistake: You can make a difference! \n “A career in CS is a chance to  \nbuild things. If you can dream  \nit, CS can help you do it!” \n— Alice Steinglass, President, Code.org \n1.

Others point to  \nstudies that indicate traditional mindsets of computing  \nas “boring” and “only for boys” as a major reason why  \ngirls and young women do not consider a degree or  \ncareer in this field. \nThat’s why I was proud to collaborate with Microsoft  \non this research, which quantifies many of my  \nobservations from over 20 years of working to  \nincrease the participation of girls and young women  \nin STEM and computing.

As you teach and give feedback, however, be certain you have provided all the tools students need to meet \nthese standards. \n7. “Wise feedback” is particularly important when pointing out \nmissteps. \nStudents are more likely to make the necessary additional effort if you clearly explain that \nyou are holding them to high standards, that your corrections identify where the students \nhave not yet met those standards, and that your suggestions tell them more about what \nwork at those standards looks like. Finally, and very importantly, clearly express your \ncon\x00dence that the students have the capacity to reach those standards. \n8. Always o\x00er the opportunity to discuss your feedback. \nIt is important that the students fully understand the point you are making and their next steps. \nRelated Resources: \nDweck, C. S.

It should employ a “growth mindset” that focuses on developing intelligence through effort and \npractice, and “wise feedback” that spurs additional effort. \n1. Explain that mental e\x00ort actually changes the brain and increases its capacity. \nThe brain responds to mental effort the way our muscles respond to exercise. When students understand that fact, \nthey are more likely to persist in the face of challenges. \n2. Tests and assignments do not assess the student’s ability or potential. \nThey only assess the student’s skills at a point in time. So, you should respond to poor performance with feedback \nsuch as “You have not completely understood this concept yet or acquired this skill yet.” \n3. Focus feedback on student progress, strategy, persistence, and \ne\x00ort. \nUse speci\x00c comments like, “Great improvement on x; you’re ready to move on,” or “Good \nprogress; you need some more practice with x.” Make no comments implying the student’s \nperformance is based on “natural” ability. Note the quality of the work, not the quality of \nthe student. \n4. Recognize that preparation and ability are not the same \nthing. \nStudents who appear \xa0“smart” have usually had more useful exposure and \nexperience. Students who catch on less quickly usually have less preparation for the \nnew work, not less potential. Give these students the foundation and practice to hone \nthe new skill or understand the new knowledge; use examples more closely aligned \nwith the students’ own backgrounds. \nK-12 \n\uf140 \nK-12 Higher E ducation \n\uf140 \nHigher E ducation \nWorkforce \n\uf140 \nWorkforce Resources \n\uf140 \nResources Programs \n\uf140 \nPrograms Media Hub News & Events \n\uf140 \nNews & Events \nAbout NC WIT \n\uf140 \nAbout NC WIT LOG IN \n\uf179 \n\ue900', '11/28/23, 1:46 PM NCWIT Tips: 8 Ways to Give Students More Effective Feedback Using a Growth Mindset | National Center for Women & Informat ... \nhttps://ncwit.org/resources/ncwit-tips-8-ways-to-give-students-more-effective-feedback-using-a-growth-mindset/ 3 / 3 \nCopyright © 2 023 National C enter for Women & Inf ormation  Technology \n\uf09a \uf099 \uf167 \uf16d \uf08c \nCreate an Account My Orders Privacy Policy Terms of Use General Code of Conduct Copyright Sitemap Charitable Registration Dis closures \n\ue900', 'Multiple Means of  \u200b Engagement   Multiple Means of  \u200b Representation   Multiple Means of  \u200b Action & Expression   \n  \nAffective Networks   \nThe “WHY” of learning   \nRecognition Networks   \nThe “WHAT” of learning   \nStrategic Networks   \nThe “HOW” of learning   \n  \nProvide options for     \nSelf Regulation   \n  \n● Communicate clear expectations for   \ncomputing tasks, collaboration, and   \nhelp seeking   \n● Develop ways for students to   \nself-assess and reflect on own   \nprojects and those of others   \n● Use assessment rubrics that   \nevaluate both content and process   \n● Break-up coding activities with   \nopportunities for reflection such as   \nturn and talks or written questions   \n● Acknowledge difficulty and   \nfrustration.

This was\xa0 Girls Creating Games , a project where girls designed and programmed their own games. It was \none of the earliest projects in our\xa0 Diversity in IT \xa0group. \nIn the world of technology professions, females, Blacks and Latinos continue to be\xa0 substantially underrepresented . \nThrough partnerships, consulting and research projects like Girls Creating Games and\xa0 The Girl Game Company , we \nhave designed and supported efforts to increase diversity in STEM \x00elds. (Find out more about the research we’ve \ndone, and a list of our group’s publications,\xa0 here .) \nOne of the strategies we’ve frequently used and studied is\xa0 pair programming . We’ve developed some classroom tips \nthat can make pair programming more effective. \nFind out about our free tip sheets on increasing diversity in STEM education\xa0 here . \nWhat\'s Pair Programming? \nPair programming is when two people program on a computer together. Each partner has a different role. One is the “Driver,” controlling the \nmouse and keyboard. One is the “Navigator,” who helps direct the driver. They complete programming tasks together, rotating roles regularly. \nWhen we started our work with middle school girls, pair programming was a strategy that had been used with some success  in industry  and  at \nthe university level  to provide peer support and encouragement. It had not been studied with youth working on computers. We felt it was time to \nsee whether it might bene\x00t middle and high school youth. \nWe designed curricula and conducted research where both girls and boys pair program to develop games and other technology projects. We \nlooked at both school-based and after-school programs. We’re excited that others are now also utilizing and researching this strategy. \nWhy Do It? \nEducators often want to pair students doing programming because they believe it will make the process more fun, less intimidating and encourage \ncollaborative learning. This intuitively makes sense. But educators don’t always know the best way to pair students or the conditions under which \npair programming has bene\x00ts for learning. We are studying  what pair programming looks like  on a deeper level, how it may or may not increase \nstudents’ engagement and learning, and which students gain the most bene\x00ts from pair programming. \nResearchers at  Harvey Mudd College  have developed a  set of strategies and tips  for computer science teaching, including tips for pair \nprogramming. We’ve developed our own set of “10 Tips” for making pair programming successful with middle school students, based on our \nresearch, our experiences with youth and the work of others in the \x00eld. We think it’s likely many of these will work with elementary and high \nschool students as well. \nMake It Work! 10 Tips \nFriendship matters . Instead of assigning pairs, let students choose their own partners. We’ve found that youth stay more engaged in the \nlearning when they can pair with a friend. This is especially effective when working with a group where retention is an issue. \nUse visible cues . After introducing the basic pair programmer roles and positive behaviors (e.g., listening to your partner, asking questions, not \nmaking fun of partner’s ideas, not grabbing the mouse, etc.), have youth brainstorm as a group to create a poster in their own words about \nwhat effective pair programming looks like. Refer to it throughout the course or project. \nPlay it out.  Use role plays to model what effective and ineffective pair programming looks like. Start with an educator in one role and a \nstudent in the other. Model positive, supportive team behaviors (e.g., listening, asking for feedback, not taking over) and not-so-positive \nbehaviors (e.g., grabbing the mouse, putting down partner’s ideas, ignoring partner). \nCreative cooperation.  Let students create their own versions of the Navigator and Driver roles. For example, sometimes one student types \nand the other manipulates the mouse. All behaviors are okay as long as they are respectful and both partners are engaged. \nDynamic duo.  Remind students that with two people, they can generate twice as many ideas and prevent twice as many mistakes. \nBeyond the computer . Do off-the-computer team-building activities where partners can practice clear communication and listening skills. \nStep-back and step-in . Encourage more assertive students to ""step-back"" in their pair to listen and respond to their partner. Encourage less \nassertive students to ""step-in"" by talking about their ideas and helping solve programming challenges. \nAddress switch resistance.  If pairs resist switching roles, give them more structure. Set up a timer or make an announcement to help them \nremember when to switch. \n\uf095 1 - 8 0 0 - 3 2 1 - 4 4 0 7', ""11/28/23, 1:44 PM Pair Programming: 10 Cool Tips to Make It Work in Your Classrooms - ETR \nhttps://www.etr.org/blog/research-pair-programming/ 3 / 3 \nSign up for the ETR Health Newsletter. \n\uf2b6  Subscribe \nSocial Media : \nETR is a 501 (c) 3\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0EIN #94-2760764 \n© 1981-2023 ETR. \nHIV, Sexual & Reproductive Health \nEquity & Inclusion in STEM \nSchool-Based Health & and Wellness \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs \nProfessional Development & Training \nProduct Development & Dissemination \nResearch \nEvaluation \nTOPICS \nSERVICES \nOur Mission & Values \nOur Staff \nOur Projects \nBlog \nBoard of Directors \nSelected Clients, Funders and Partners \nContract with Us \nCareers \nContact Us \nHealth Equity Framework \nDr. Doug Kirby's Legacy \nABOUT US \nCatalog \nLatest Products \nShop By... \nPrivacy Policy \nTerms of Use \nUse of Cookies \nPermissions Request Form \nFinancial Conflict of Interest policy \nSTORE \nOTHER RESOURCES \nAccount Management Team \n5619 Scotts Valley Drive \nSuite 140 \nScotts Valley, CA 95066 \nEmail Support:  customerservice@etr.org \nCONTACT US"", '11/28/23, 1:34 PM Code and Poetry, a Conversation.

Computer code has nothing in common with poetry. Poetry \nis grace, and code is function. Poetry connotes. Code commands. \nMe:   But both try to represent complex ideas in concrete form. Poets build \nintimate impressions out of inadequate words. Coders instruct alien objects \nusing a vocabulary rooted in the Middle Ages. Both perform their own kind \nof sorcery with a language designed for more humdrum tasks. \nYou:  But poets are aesthetes, fashioning sentient imagery through language \nand form.

Both are human. Both aspire to elegance \nof a sort. \nYou:  Computer code is elegant? How can zeroes and ones be elegant? \nMe:  Programmers rarely work in zeroes and ones. Their code is written for \nhuman consumption just as much as for machines. Humans must \nunderstand code because it’s their job to debug and maintain it—moreover, \nexpressive (even beautiful) code is how new idioms proliferate and the \nlanguage evolves. \nYou:   Okay, but the code must work.

AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) was designed specifically to attract \nthese students to the field. While  AP Computer Science  A is a more traditional coding-based class, that \ndoesn’t mean that diversity is any less important. \nTo create a diverse  AP class, make an extra ef fort to recruit girls and underrepresented minorities.  Your \nencouragement will spark new pathways for these students. \nThe evidence-based strategies below will help you recruit all students. \nRecruit Groups \nRecruit students from groups that represent your target demographic populations. Look to sports groups, \nclubs, or other courses to find students who will enroll and provide social support to one another in the \nclassroom. For example, the girls’  basketball team, the Spanish club, the Black Student Union, or the \nAVID program. \nInvite Students Personally \nAP computer science teachers can visit algebra classes to invite all students to enroll in their class the \nfollowing year—once students complete an algebra course, they’ve met the recommended prerequisites. \nIn your school’ s presentation and handouts: \nDescribe the course’ s key topics and computational practices, including creativity , programming, \nand the internet.

For example, during \nComputer Science Education W eek (which usually takes place in early December) and spring enrollment \nweeks, you can arrange for students to showcase their computing projects and talk about their \nexperience in the course. It’ s a good idea to take videos of students’  projects for future recruitment. \nYou can also schedule a middle school demonstration and have current or former high school students \npresent their work and talk about the course. \nOur  AP CSP student site  (https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science- \nprinciples/about)  and our  Recruitment  Toolkit  (/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/recruitment- \ntoolkit)  page host a number of videos in which real  AP CSP students talk about their experience in the \ncourse. Share these testimonials with your students. \nReach Out to Parents \nDuring family-oriented school events and in letters home, provide a single-page course information sheet \nthat features: \nKey questions and topics that drive the courses \nPotential community applications of computer science \nInformation about higher education computing majors and pathways \nInformation on potential scholarships \nInformation about jobs in the industry , including salaries \nLetters and course information sheets should be available in multiple languages.']"
How to optimize individual choie and autonomy?,"In an instructional setting, it is often inappropriate to provide choice of the learning objective itself, but it is often appropriate to offer choices in how that objective can be reached, in the context for achieving the objective, in the tools or supports available, and so forth.

How do I set up a circle?,"Start with the physical space. After years of practice, I have a routine: On my centerpiece—a beautiful round, knitted blanket I received from a colleague—I place a talking piece that acts as a physical signifier indicating whose voice we are listening to at any time. I use a rock, crystal, stuffed animal, or toy. Around the centerpiece are enough chairs for all participants; the chairs must be in close proximity to foster intimacy.
Next, set up the purpose and expectations. If it’s the first circle with a group, I have an overview printed to use as a guide. I explain the overarching purpose of circle: to form a community with open lines of communication, which is so important to taking intellectual risks.","Start by setting up the physical space with a centerpiece and chairs in close proximity. Place a talking piece on the centerpiece to indicate whose voice is being listened to at any time. Next, establish the purpose and expectations of the circle, including the norms of speaking from the heart, listening from the heart, speaking spontaneously, speaking leanly, and keeping what is shared in the circle within the circle. After this, explain the three basic components of a circle routine: opening, prompts, and closing. The opening includes the norming already discussed and a moment of mindfulness, as well as an icebreaker question to invite everyone's voice into the space without threat. The prompts are what allow the circle to serve your specific purpose, and can be tailored to your students and your purpose. Finally, the closing offers an opportunity for participants to transition in a healthy way, and it's critical to remind participants that what was shared in the circle stays in the circle.","['11/28/23, 1:47 PM Using Circle Practice in the Classroom | Edutopia \nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/using-circle-practice-classroom 2 / 10 \nNext, set up the purpose and expectations.

Though it originated in the context of criminal justice, RJ has become \npopular in schools as many educators use it as an alternative to traditional discipline approaches—it’s a shift from \nfocusing on consequences to focusing on responsibility and relationships. \nBut RJ and circle practice can also be used to serve academic, social and emotional, and reflective purposes with \nour students. \nS E T T I N G   U P   A   C I R C L E \nStart with the physical space. After years of practice, I have a routine: On my centerpiece—a beautiful round, \nknitted blanket I received from a colleague—I place a talking piece that acts as a physical signifier indicating whose \nvoice we are listening to at any time. I use a rock, crystal, stuffed animal, or toy. Around the centerpiece are enough \nchairs for all participants; the chairs must be in close proximity to foster intimacy. \nG E O R G E   L U C A S   E D U C A T I O N A L   F O U N D A T I O N', '11/28/23, 1:47 PM Using Circle Practice in the Classroom | Edutopia \nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/using-circle-practice-classroom 3 / 10 \nTeaching Strategies Social & Emotional Learning (SEL) 9-12 High School \nneed from your peers to be successful? What are your learning pet peeves? How do you feel about reading, writing, \nand/or speaking? \nOne way to use circles to build relationships is to print out several “get to know you” questions (I’ve compiled a list \nof  a couple hundred of these ), \nlay them around the centerpiece, and let students pick which questions to use for the prompt rounds. Students can \nalso craft their own questions to ask each other. \nRestorative justice is a traditional use of circles. After conflicts or other difficult situations, you can ask: What \nhappened? Why did it happen? Who was affected, and how? How do we repair the wrongs? \nA related use of circles is caring for students in moments of stress or trauma. After a heartbreaking flare-up of gang \nviolence in our city, my students and I wept together in circle, answering questions like: What makes you feel \nafraid? What makes you feel safe? What do you need? How can we move the community forward? \nCircles can serve academic purposes as well. For example, before beginning Leslie Marmon Silko’s  Ceremony , I \nprinted out articles with information about issues affecting Native Americans and laid them on the centerpiece with \nbaskets of pens, pencils, and Post-its. I had students pick an article and read and annotate it. Then I asked \nquestions such as: What predictions do you have about the novel based on these articles? What is something that \nstood out to you, and why? \nCircles can serve any purpose—all you need are meaningful prompts. \nThe closing:  Because circles can be so powerful, they necessitate closure. There are a couple ways to do this. You \ncan keep it light with a group high five or a  silly coordination game . You \ncan do a witness round in which participants share one word on their mind. The closing offers an opportunity for \nparticipants to transition in a healthy way. It’s critical to remind participants of the norm that what was shared in the \ncircle stays in the circle. \nSome of my most memorable (I dare say magical) moments in the classroom have been inside of a circle, and they \nare always treasured moments of community and communication. And I think my students would say the same. \nS H A R E   T H I S   S T O R Y \nF I L E D   U N D E R \nS T U D E N T   E N G A G E M E N T \n4 Practices of Warm Demander Teachers \nA well-known approach that combines high expectations with a firm belief \nin students’ ability to succeed can guide them to deeper learning. \nB y   Jessica Huang \nNovember 28, 2023 \n(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAJCXCB4RgndFwnaxfyJFicjul_lqaX9n46xyWKWt5U/edit?usp=sharing) \n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqCQ_DZ2NNk)', '11/28/23, 1:43 PM How to Prepare School Staff for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Initiatives | Edutopia \nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/preparing-staff-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-initiatives 3 / 11 \nDiversity Administration & Leadership Education Equity \n5.

What are five things I can do to engage girls in CS?,"You can provide role models, generate excitinment, provide hands-on experiences, provide encouragement, and encourage a growth mindset. ","According to research commissioned by Microsoft, some strategies to engage girls in computer science include providing role models, generating excitement about the creativity and potential for impact in CS, providing hands-on experiences with coding and CS, providing encouragement and demonstrating confidence in their ability, and encouraging a ""growth mindset."" Teachers and guidance counselors can also be effective ambassadors for engaging girls in CS classes and activities by providing encouragement both at school and at home. Additionally, supporting extracurricular STEM activities that teach girls how to create and build confidence, emphasizing the creative aspects of STEM and computer science, and demonstrating the dramatic impact that STEM and computer science jobs have on the world can also be effective strategies.","['5 \nYour voice is important \nTeachers and guidance counselors are some of  \nthe best ambassadors for engaging girls in CS  \nclasses and activities. Encouragement can make a  \nbig difference in young women’s interest in STEM  \n— especially when it happens both at school and  \nat home. \nOur research shows that when girls are  \nencouraged by teachers and parents, they’re  \nmore than twice as likely to consider studying CS  \nin high school and three times more likely to say  \nthey’ll study it in college compared to girls who  \nget no encouragement from either a parent or  \nteacher. \n1 \nPutting this toolkit to use \n•   R  ecruitment Roadmap.

It’s also fun to  \nteach a diverse classroom.” \n— Mary Davison, Career and  \nTechnical Education Director,  \nSeattle Public Schools', '4 \nWhat can you do? \nResearch commissioned by Microsoft in 2017 tells us that girls want to be creative and create change in the  \nworld, but many don’t realize CS can give them the opportunities to do just that.  \nThe research, which included an extensive review of existing studies, interviews with subject matter experts,  \nand a quantitative survey of more than 6,000 girls and young women from ages 10 to 30, reveals five  \ninsights you can turn into action: \nProvide role models  so girls and young women can see themselves in the field. For example, invite female  \nCS professionals to talk to students about their work and show them the possibilities of CS. Be mindful to  \nreflect a diverse range of women in terms of race, ability, gender expression and careers.  \nGenerate excitement  with a steady narrative about how CS careers are creative and critical to solving real- \nworld problems. (See http://makewhatsnext.com/careers/ .) Put up posters and displays that highlight the  \ncreative possibilities in CS. \nProvide hands-on experiences  so students can better understand what CS is all about. Introduce immersive  \nlessons and learning experiences, take field trips to local companies, and offer “learn by doing” apps, games  \nand other tools. Be sure that you consider the transportation and other needs of girls and students with fewer  \nresources.  \nProvide encouragement.  Girls who are encouraged in CS by a parent or teacher are more likely to say they’ll  \nstudy CS. Actively support girls who show an interest in CS. Talk with parents about the role of CS in future  \ncareers and the importance of support and encouragement at home. And provide school counselors with info  \nand resources for supporting girls in CS. (See https://www.ncwit.org/project/counselors-computing-c4c .) \nEncourage a “growth mindset”  by treating questions, discovery and even failure as positive parts of the  \nlearning process. (See www.ncwit.org/resources/ncwit-tips-8-ways-give-students-more-effective- feedback- \nusing-growth-mindset-0 .) \nWe invite you to adopt some of these specific ways you can achieve greater diversity in CS. Then share these  \nresources with other education leaders as you educate and inspire the next generation of computer scientists. \n     Closing the gender gap isn’t up to the students alone.  \nIt’s up to us — to change our behaviors, strategies and  \nsystems so that these classes and careers reflect    \nthe diversity in our communities. \n— Dr. Brad McLain, Senior Research Scientist, National Center   \nfor Women and Information Technology \n1.

These include: \n•  Provide more exposure to positive role models  \nand mentors they can both relate to and  \naspire to be. \n•  Demonstrate a path forward in terms of  \nturning an interest in STEM and computer  \nscience into success in school and in a career. \n•  Support extracurricular STEM activities that  \nteach girls how to create and build confidence. \n•  Provide hands-on experiences and real-world  \nexamples. \n•  Emphasize the creative aspects of STEM  \nand computer science. \n•  Demonstrate the dramatic impact that STEM  \nand computer science jobs have on the world. \n•  Encourage parents, teachers and others  \ninfluential in a girl’s life to support and foster  \ninterest in STEM and computer science. \n•  Support teachers to develop strategies  \nto engage students who are afraid to ask  \nquestions, be wrong or ask for additional help. \n•  Listen to what girls say about their challenges  \nand desires. \nThe last bullet may be the most important. We know that some girls and young women thrive in STEM  \nand computer science studies and careers, while others are stymied and choose not to proceed.

In the case of BIPOC (Black, \nIndigenous and people of color) students, unconscious beliefs and attitudes can lead  to \nharmful microaggressions and erroneous expectations  about their overall potential. \nHere are some examples of how implicit bias can appear in schools: \nTeachers may assume students belonging to certain groups have limited intellectual \nabilities, which lowers their academic achievement expectations. \nMath teachers may perceive the rigor in their class to be too challenging for Black and \nLatinx students. \nScience teachers may perceive their class to be too difficult for non-Asian and non-white \nstudents. \nTeachers may automatically categorize students according to racial and cultural \nstereotypes. \nTo dismantle implicit bias in schools, individual teachers but preferably within PLCs as part \nof diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work, need to focus on what they believe about \nstudents, their expectations for them and how they can influence their success. One strategy \na team of educators can use to address implicit bias is  circle practice  in which participants \ngather to speak and listen from the heart and agree to accept feedback when their \nperspective needs changing.

4) Take your time 
5) Cut back on homework 
6) Show, don't just tell 
7) Access is key 
8) Provide a comment box 
9) Be available. Additionally, educators can assess their own implicit bias and use empathy mapping to increase their knowledge of students. It's also important to focus on what you believe about students, your expectations for them, and how you can influence their success. Circle practice can be a useful strategy for addressing implicit bias within PLCs as part of diversity, equity, and inclusion work.","['Additional Online Resources: \nTips for Reducing Bias (csteachingtips) \nhttp://csteachingtips.org/images/BestOf/CSTT_ReducingBias.pdf \nFostering Equity (Safe@School) \nhttp://www.safeatschool.ca/plm/equity-and-inclusion/strategies-for-positive-action/fostering-equity \nEquity in the Classroom Through Culturally Conscious Instruction (ASCD) \nhttp://annualconference.ascd.org/attendee/conference-daily/2015/classroom-equity.aspx \nEquity Resources (Rice Precollege Science Education) \nhttp://www.bioc.rice.edu/precollege/ei/best_practices.html#classroom \n3 Practices to Promote Equity in the Classroom (Edutopia) \nhttp://www.edutopia.org/blog/practices-promote-equity-in-classroom-shane-safir \nFraming a Supportive Classroom Climate (NCWIT) \nhttps://www.ncwit.org/resources/how-do-you-recruit-or-retain-women-through-inclusive-pedagogy/  \nframing-supportive-classroom \nEqual Access: Inclusive Strategies for Teaching Students with Disabilities (NCWIT) \nhttps://www.ncwit.org/resources/how-do-you-recruit-or-retain-women-through-inclusive-pedagogy/  \nequal-access-inclusive \nToolkit for Assessing and Promoting Equity in the Classroom (UNICEF) \nhttp://www.unicef.org/lifeskills/files/AssessingEquity-EIC_Toolkit.pdf \nTen Steps to Equity in Education (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) \nhttp://www.oecd.org/education/school/39989494.pdf \nImages of Computer Science: Perceptions Among Students, Parents and Educators in the U.S. (Google) \nhttps://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/images-of-computer-science-report.pdf \nEDEquity Resources (EDEquity) \nhttp://www.edequity.com/edequity-resources.php \nTeaching To Promote Gender Equality (The Center for Teaching Excellence) \nhttp://cte.virginia.edu/resources/teaching-a-diverse-student-body-practical-strategies-for-enhancing-  \nour-students-learning/gender-dynamics-in-the-classroom/teaching-to-promote-gender-equality/', 'S \ntr at \negies \nEquality \n9 T ips f or Pr omoting E quity in the Clas sr  oom \nCompiled b y C ode .or  g fr om r esources  \nUNICE F, Google , NC WIT , Ric e  \nUni versity , EDE quity Inc., E dut opia,  \nc steachingtips, S AFE@SCHOOL,  \nT he C ent er f or T eaching Ex cellenc e ,  \nT \nhe Or ganisa tion f or E conomic  \nC o-oper ation and De velopment \nDiv \nersity \nEquity \nEduc \na \ntion \nOpportunity \nFair \nStr ength \nLearning \nAtt ention \nConscious \nStudents \nTeaching \n1) Dec or  ate with purpose -  Your pos ters, books, and r ef  er  enc e  \nallo w each s tudent t o f eel a sense of belonging. \n2) Mak e e ye c ontact -  Try t o c onsciously spend time looking a t  \nand enc our aging s tudents, especially those who appear les s  \nconfident or ar e hesitant t o engage .  \n3) Call on e very one -  You might not r ealiz e tha t some s tudents  \nget called on significantly les s than others, but the y notic e!    \nTry using a r andomiz er t o help with s tudent selection.

In the case of BIPOC (Black, \nIndigenous and people of color) students, unconscious beliefs and attitudes can lead  to \nharmful microaggressions and erroneous expectations  about their overall potential. \nHere are some examples of how implicit bias can appear in schools: \nTeachers may assume students belonging to certain groups have limited intellectual \nabilities, which lowers their academic achievement expectations. \nMath teachers may perceive the rigor in their class to be too challenging for Black and \nLatinx students. \nScience teachers may perceive their class to be too difficult for non-Asian and non-white \nstudents. \nTeachers may automatically categorize students according to racial and cultural \nstereotypes. \nTo dismantle implicit bias in schools, individual teachers but preferably within PLCs as part \nof diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work, need to focus on what they believe about \nstudents, their expectations for them and how they can influence their success. One strategy \na team of educators can use to address implicit bias is  circle practice  in which participants \ngather to speak and listen from the heart and agree to accept feedback when their \nperspective needs changing. The SEL in Action guide provides good question prompts for \nframing this process. \nEmpathy mapping \nUsing empathy maps to increase our knowledge of students can be a nifty tool that teachers \nuse to support DEI and SEL efforts in their schools and classrooms.

It should employ a “growth mindset” that focuses on developing intelligence through effort and \npractice, and “wise feedback” that spurs additional effort. \n1. Explain that mental e\x00ort actually changes the brain and increases its capacity. \nThe brain responds to mental effort the way our muscles respond to exercise. When students understand that fact, \nthey are more likely to persist in the face of challenges. \n2. Tests and assignments do not assess the student’s ability or potential. \nThey only assess the student’s skills at a point in time. So, you should respond to poor performance with feedback \nsuch as “You have not completely understood this concept yet or acquired this skill yet.” \n3. Focus feedback on student progress, strategy, persistence, and \ne\x00ort. \nUse speci\x00c comments like, “Great improvement on x; you’re ready to move on,” or “Good \nprogress; you need some more practice with x.” Make no comments implying the student’s \nperformance is based on “natural” ability. Note the quality of the work, not the quality of \nthe student. \n4. Recognize that preparation and ability are not the same \nthing. \nStudents who appear \xa0“smart” have usually had more useful exposure and \nexperience. Students who catch on less quickly usually have less preparation for the \nnew work, not less potential.

Feedback should o\x00er speci\x00c guidance on how to change. \nMake clear what needs to be different about students’ work by breaking the task into small steps and identifying \ntheir speci\x00c missteps.

Initially, give students support to guide them through their practice, and gradually remove the support as \nthe students get each small step down cold. \n6. Do not lower standards for success. \nSet your standards high and tell students the truth about how their performance compares with those standards \nthus far. As you teach and give feedback, however, be certain you have provided all the tools students need to meet \nthese standards. \n7. “Wise feedback” is particularly important when pointing out \nmissteps. \nStudents are more likely to make the necessary additional effort if you clearly explain that \nyou are holding them to high standards, that your corrections identify where the students \nhave not yet met those standards, and that your suggestions tell them more about what \nwork at those standards looks like.

Build the culture of your school on an institutional level:  Think of yourself as an agent for a healthy, antiracist \nculture, not as the sole creator of it. Leaders in schools should not be responsible for managing or mediating every \nsingle aggression (micro- or macro-), but they should be explicit about expectations and values. Make sure that the \nnorms of communication around microaggressions (indeed, around any racist behavior) are clear, including to new \nstaff members. \n2. Ritualize meeting spaces:  Develop humanizing ways to begin and close meetings. Check-in questions (e.g., \nchecking in on highs and lows), sharing across differences (e.g., “From the skin I am in...”), and mindful practices at \nthe beginning of a meeting help to bring folks into a shared space. Closing rituals such as process checks, which \nsurface patterns of participation and facilitator moves, bring a reflective and purposeful closing tone. Developing \nconsistent meeting structures and roles helps to flatten positional hierarchy, especially in cultures that put a strong \nemphasis on titles and positions. \n3. Prioritize a shared vision and language:  Make sure the adults in the building are employing the same language \nand concepts when it comes to antiracism work. This allows for individuals to access shared values and concepts \nwhen attempting to have brave conversations with their students and colleagues. Terms such as  implicit bias , \nstructural racism ,  White supremacy , and  microaggressions  should be explicitly taught, discussed, and defined within \nthe context of the local school community and history. \n4. Establish norms that create brave spaces:  While they have merit in certain contexts, safe spaces are sometimes \ntoo safe and enable some folks to lean on their “right to comfort,” a symptom of White supremacy culture that aims \nto smooth over conflict without getting to the root of the issues. Instead, norms should reflect a culture of curiosity, \nlistening, and vulnerability: bravery. In brave spaces, adults can work in their optimal zone of development. \n5. Practice a culture of microaffirmations:  In  one study , conducted \nby SF Build, an organization founded to mentor students of color in the sciences, microaffirmations are described as \n“affirmations that people of your culture and ethnicity are important contributors to advancing knowledge in this \nfield.” SF Build’s research found that the practice of microaffirmations directly correlates with a student’s intention to \npersist in a field. \nIf microaffirmations have a strong impact on the persistence of college freshmen in the sciences, they can also \nactively contribute to the sense of belonging of students and faculty of color in an international environment. To me, \nmicroaffirmations can include explicit recognition of a person’s contributions and skills and images of excellence of \nwomen and the contributions of people of color to any field of study. \n6. Hire and retain a diverse faculty and staff:  Your faculty and staff should reflect the majority of the young people \nthey are working with; if you work in an international school like I do, then they should reflect the global majority of \nstudents. The world is increasingly interconnected, and issues of colonization, oppression, and social justice are \nbeing valued by government agencies, Fortune 500 businesses, and universities. Schools need to hire and retain \nfaculty and staff of color to reflect the diversity that students will experience when they enter higher education and \nthe workforce. \nMoreover, a diverse faculty will naturally bring a wider range of viewpoints and experiences to share with students \nand the community. Value this diversity of viewpoints, and use these perspectives to build shared understanding and \nexpectations with students and families about what school values stand for. \n7. Engage in storytelling:  Storytelling helps to build intentional personal and professional relationships around \nshared values and identity. As an ancient tradition, storytelling activates emotions, helps people build connections, \nand supports the storyteller in anchoring their identity within their own context. It is a powerful way to build \n(https://sfbuild.sfsu.edu/sites/default/files/Estrada_2019.pdf)']"
How can I begin with empathy mapping?,"Creating empathy maps is relatively simple once you gather pertinent information about your students. This may
include their goals, hobbies, interests, and areas of academic, career, and social needs, as well as data from
assessments. Traditional ways of collecting this information about students can be through polls, surveys, and
looking at student work (e.g., reflection journals, essays, digital portfolios, and passion-project-based learning
projects). Knowledge about students can also be gleaned in classroom discussions aimed at checking in and
building rapport, paying attention to what they care about (e.g., social issues), recognizing their gifts and abilities in
how they transfer learning and in things they voluntarily talk about. You should  update this data throughout the school year to keep up as kids change.","To begin with empathy mapping, gather pertinent information about your students, including their goals, hobbies, interests, and areas of academic, career, and social needs, as well as data from assessments.

Sometimes the kids change, and so should \nour perspective when empathizing with them. The key here is to use what we know to create a better school \nexperience for them. Some examples of using what we know about students through our curations may include \ndeveloping unit or project themes they care about, considering how they may want to transfer learning through the \nproducts they create, and the themes of other class-based activities (field trips, clubs, etc.). \nC O N S T R U C T I N G   T H E   M A P \nNow that we have some pertinent data, we can begin the mapping process. Treat this as a fun and informative \nexperience—we’re creating an artifact for increasing our understanding to help students. We won’t always get it \nperfect, so it should be considered a working outline. \nIf you want to freehand your empathy map or collaborate with others, the only materials needed are paper, sticky \nnotes, and markers. I prefer to print worksheets from  a template \n(https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/LLD2C-Empathy-Map-Template.pdf)  I created with the following five sections: \n1. Interests and goals.  These items should motivate, inspire, and emotionally compel them. \n2. Areas of strength.  These are areas that a student excels in. Knowing their assets can be leveraged by using what \nthey are good at to help them build on what they need to improve. \n3. Academic needs.  Areas of academic weakness in this section of the empathy map will vary among the content \nareas (i.e., English language arts, math, science, and social studies). Pay close attention to important concepts and \nskills that they will need for making cross-curricular connections. Here are some examples of concepts and skills \nthat cut across multiple disciplines: \nAbility to interpret informational text \nUnderstanding cause and effect \nUnit conversion (proportional reasoning) \nDeveloping habits of mind \nUsing design thinking for designing from the perspective of the end user \nDisaggregated summative and formative assessment of key data points can also be addressed here for helping to drive future \nremedial/instruction focuses. \n4. SEL needs.  The integrated framework developed by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional \nLearning, or CASEL, offers essential competence areas that students need to hone their understanding, abilities, \nand attitudes across. These include self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and \nresponsible decision-making.', '11/28/23, 1:46 PM How Empathy Maps Can Help Teachers Connect With Middle and High School Students | Edutopia \nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/how-simple-visual-tool-can-help-teachers-connect-students 2 / 11 \nA W eekly Dose of W hat Works \nSign up for the  Edutopia Weekly , a newsletter with personalized, time-saving strategies shared by experienced educators \nand backed by evidence. \nYes, I want that \n(/account/signup?grades=&subscribe=weeklyNewsletter) \nIn education, an empathy map is a simple visual that captures knowledge about the behaviors, attitudes, needs, \nstrengths, struggles, emotional states, and other key attributes of a particular student or group of students. In my \ncoaching work with schools, the empathy-mapping process primarily becomes a helpful tool to assist grade-level \nplanning teams in empathizing with their students and developing more equitable and personalized lessons. \nCreating maps helps teachers consider things from the students’ perspectives and takes into account a child’s \ninterests and challenges. \nEmpathy maps also provide the following benefits: \nAdditional opportunities to make better instructional decisions based on the true needs of students, \nA better understanding of students and their life/academic circumstances, \nPertinent student information in one visual reference, \nCallouts of key insights gleaned from data or research, \nA common understanding among adults in a school, and \nAn equity-based, collaborative tool for teachers and other stakeholders who interact with the same students—which can be \nhelpful for systemic diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) work. \nH O W   T O   B E G I N   E M P A T H Y   M A P P I N G', '11/28/23, 1:46 PM How Empathy Maps Can Help Teachers Connect With Middle and High School Students | Edutopia \nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/how-simple-visual-tool-can-help-teachers-connect-students 4 / 11 \nTeaching Strategies Culturally Responsive Teaching 6-8 Middle School \n9-12 High School \n5. Career needs.  Career needs are an optional label in empathy mapping, as not all teachers focus their instruction \non careers. However, content-area teachers should make career connections to the academic concepts and skills \nthat they teach. Essential career skills like self-management, problem-solving, and the four Cs (communication, \ncollaboration, creativity, and critical thinking) can be addressed as needed. \nCareer and technical education (CTE) teachers should map to identify areas of weakness that prevent learners from \nbeing fully informed about the benefits of developing or following an individual college and career plan. \nIt’s important to point out that educators are not bound to use only the five labels suggested above. Feel free to \npersonalize the process and include labels relevant to your teaching context. \nU S I N G   E M P A T H Y   M A P S \nThe empathy maps we design are helpful only if we use them. I like to use mine to guide instructional decisions that \nbest support my learners (e.g., instructional scaffolds and personalizing learning) and to avoid cognitive overload \nfor them by incorporating activities in lessons that promote learning as productive struggle—and not frustration. \nIn my DEI work, I have found the empathy mapping practice extremely useful for determining where I needed to \nbecome more socially and culturally competent regarding the students with whom colleagues and I are striving to \nempathize. \nThe push for advancing equity in schools has made educators aware that we must find creative but practical ways to \nunderstand students culturally, socially, and academically. Through empathy mapping, you may discover those \nessential points to consider to help them learn and apply the life, social, and academic skills that are appropriate for \nthem. \nS H A R E   T H I S   S T O R Y \nF I L E D   U N D E R \nS T U D E N T   E N G A G E M E N T \n4 Practices of Warm Demander Teachers \nA well-known approach that combines high expectations with a firm belief \nin students’ ability to succeed can guide them to deeper learning. \nB y   Jessica Huang \nNovember 28, 2023', '11/28/23, 1:46 PM How Empathy Maps Can Help Teachers Connect With Middle and High School Students | Edutopia \nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/how-simple-visual-tool-can-help-teachers-connect-students 1 / 11 \nT E A C H I N G   S T R A T E G I E S \nHow a Simple Visual Tool Can Help Teachers Connect With \nStudents \nPulling together information about a student into what’s known as an \nempathy map can help teachers provide better instruction. \nB y   Jorge Valenzuela \nApril 12, 2021 \nAllison Shelley for the Alliance for Excellent Education \nBeing empathic toward students directly correlates with our ability to share in their feelings and perspectives and \nunderstand their academic needs. \nEmpathy maps can be a scaffold that individual teachers or grade-level teams use to begin empathizing with \nstudents while simultaneously increasing their knowledge of them—which is critical for raising equity in schools.
