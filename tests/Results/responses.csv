Can a school with a well-qualified teacher jump right to the Lab Support Model?,"Yes. We partner with teachers who can teach CS on their own but who may benefit from having a teacher's assistant in the classroom to provide industry-specific knowledge, be a role model, help support more students, and support with technical knowledge. In placing volunteers, we prioritize schools that do not currently have computer science but wish to offer it.","Yes, it is possible for a high school with a qualified teacher to directly implement the Lab Support Model with TEALS.","['How TEALS supports your school \nCo -Teach model Lab support model Graduation \nWhoâs doing  \nthe i nstruction? \nTeacher:  10  \uf0d2 80% \nVolunteer:  90  \uf0d2 20% \nTeacher:  80  \uf0d2  99% \nVolunteer:  20  \uf0d2 1% \nTeacher:  100% \nTeacherâs role \nâ¢ Classroom and teaching team  \nmanagement \nâ¢ Learning computer science \nâ¢ Completing all assignments \nâ¢ Leading lessons at their  \ncapaci \nty \nâ¢ Classroom and teaching  \ntea \nm management \nâ¢ Leading 80%+ of lessons \nâ¢ Continue refining CS  \nunderst \nanding \nâ¢ Teaching computer science  \nindepe \nndently of TEALS \nVolunteer team  \nengagement \n4-5 days a week 2-5 days a week \nSchools teach CS on \nthe \nir own \nRemote instruction \nTEALS offers options for remote or in - \nperson volunteer support.
